we have 2 type of nodes in kubernates cluster


1-master nodes: the master node hosts the control plane components, which are responsible for managing the cluster and orchestrating its operations.


API Server: This component provides the Kubernetes API,
which serves as the primary interface for interacting with the cluster.
It processes RESTful API requests, performs authentication and authorization, and updates the cluster state stored in etcd.


Scheduler: The scheduler is responsible for assigning pods to nodes based on resource requirements,
node constraints, and other factors specified in the pod's configuration.
It ensures that pods are scheduled onto suitable nodes within the cluster.



Controller Manager: The controller manager includes various controllers that are responsible for managing different aspects of the cluster's state
and performing reconciliation loops to ensure that the desired state matches the actual state of the cluster.
Examples of controllers include the Replication Controller, ReplicaSet Controller, and Endpoint Controller.

etcd: etcd is a distributed key-value store that serves as the cluster's backing store for all persistent data.
It stores the cluster's configuration data, state information, and metadata about objects such as pods, services, and nodes.



2-worker nodes :worker nodes (also known as worker or minion nodes) are responsible for running the actual workloads, including containers/pods.



Runtime: The container runtime, such as Docker or containerd, is responsible for running containerized applications within pods on the worker node.
It manages the lifecycle of containers, including image downloading, container creation, starting, stopping, and deleting.


Kubelet: The kubelet is an agent that runs on each worker node and is responsible for managing containers, pods, and their associated resources.
it communicates with the Kubernetes API server to receive instructions about pod deployment, management, and health monitoring.





kube-proxy: kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each worker node and is responsible for implementing Kubernetes networking services.
It maintains network rules on nodes and performs network address translation (NAT)
for pods to ensure that network communication between pods and services is properly routed within the cluster.

key componets of kubernates


-------Pod-------

A Kubernetes pod is a collection of one or more LinuxÂ® containers, and is the smallest unit of a Kubernetes application.
with shared volume and network resources and specification to how to run the contaienrs



----------Deployment & ReplicaSet----------

A ReplicaSet is a lower-level abstraction that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

we can create single pod but in real world but its rare we use Deployment to manager kubernates apps.
A Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and Pods.
It provides declarative updates to pods and ReplicaSets, ensuring that a specified number of pods are running at any given time.
Deployments also provide features like scaling, rolling updates, and rollback functionality.


---------Voloumes-------------


in a kubernates cluster files in contaienr R considerd short-lived, it means if the pods is gone the data it had is also gone.
the soultion to this is kubermates voluems. a volume is directory accessible to the containers in a pod, the data in the volume will
persist no matter whats happens to the containers.
