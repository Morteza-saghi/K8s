# Kubernetes Cluster Overview

## Node Types in Kubernetes Cluster

### 1. Master Nodes
The master node hosts the control plane components, which are responsible for managing the cluster and orchestrating its operations.

#### API Server
- Provides the Kubernetes API, the primary interface for interacting with the cluster.
- Processes RESTful API requests, performs authentication and authorization, and updates the cluster state stored in etcd.

#### Scheduler
- Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements, node constraints, and other factors specified in the pod's configuration.
- Ensures pods are scheduled onto suitable nodes within the cluster.

#### Controller Manager
- Includes various controllers responsible for managing different aspects of the cluster's state and performing reconciliation loops.
- Examples of controllers: Replication Controller, ReplicaSet Controller, Endpoint Controller.

#### etcd
- A distributed key-value store that serves as the cluster's backing store for all persistent data.
- Stores the cluster's configuration data, state information, and metadata about objects such as pods, services, and nodes.

### 2. Worker Nodes
Worker nodes (also known as worker or minion nodes) are responsible for running the actual workloads, including containers/pods.

#### Runtime
- The container runtime, such as Docker or containerd, runs containerized applications within pods on the worker node.
- Manages the lifecycle of containers, including image downloading, container creation, starting, stopping, and deleting.

#### Kubelet
- An agent that runs on each worker node, responsible for managing containers, pods, and their associated resources.
- Communicates with the Kubernetes API server to receive instructions about pod deployment, management, and health monitoring.

#### kube-proxy
- A network proxy that runs on each worker node, responsible for implementing Kubernetes networking services.
- Maintains network rules on nodes and performs network address translation (NAT) for pods to ensure proper routing within the cluster.

## Key Components of Kubernetes

### Pod
A Kubernetes pod is a collection of one or more LinuxÂ® containers and is the smallest unit of a Kubernetes application. Pods share volume and network resources and specify how to run the containers.

### Deployment & ReplicaSet

#### ReplicaSet
- Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

#### Deployment
- Manages ReplicaSets and Pods.
- Provides declarative updates to pods and ReplicaSets, ensuring a specified number of pods are running at any given time.
- Offers features like scaling, rolling updates, and rollback functionality.

### Volumes
In a Kubernetes cluster, files in a container are considered short-lived. If the pod is gone, the data it had is also gone. Kubernetes volumes solve this problem. A volume is a directory accessible to the containers in a pod, and the data in the volume will persist regardless of what happens to the containers.
